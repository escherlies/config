# Desktop Configuration

This repository shares my desktop configuration setup with Nix home manager, Hammerspoon, and a custom keyboard layout.

- [Nix Home Manager](./home.nix) for easy package management for my most used packages (alongside nix-shell for project specific stuff).
- [Hammerspoon](./hammerspoon.lua) for keyboard shotcuts/hotkeys. It uses lua as scripting language and not some unnessesary DSL.
- [Keyboard Configuration](./keyboard) for my keyboardlayout featuring Colemak-DH, a custom layers for special characters and a custom layer with numbers on the home row.
